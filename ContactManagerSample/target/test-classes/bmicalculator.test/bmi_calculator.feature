Scenario Outline: Calculate Body Mass Index
    Given I launch the app
    Then I enter "<Height>" as height
    And I enter "<Weight>" as weight
    And I press the Calculate button
    Then I should see "<BMI>" as bmi and "<Category>" as category

  Examples:
  |Height |Weight |BMI  |Category   |
  |170    |50     |17.30|Underweight|
  |181    |80     |24.42|Normal     |
  |180    |90     |27.78|Overweight |
  |175    |100    |32.65|Obese      |
